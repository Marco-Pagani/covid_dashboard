## A visualization tool for the latest numbers relating to the COVID19 pandemic

This project leverages a number of useful tools to help you understand the state of the world during this confusing crisis.

* Using the power of [D3](https://d3js.org/), see the latest numbers in a variety of formats that can help you understand how things are progressing in realtime.
* [Coming soon] Ask for the numbers you need to see, using [Google Dialogflow](https://dialogflow.com/), watch your queries be transformed into custon graphs for the locations and times you're seeking.

All this thanks to the wonderful [statistics API](https://github.com/ExpDev07/coronavirus-tracker-api) created by [ExpDev](https://github.com/ExpDev07).
